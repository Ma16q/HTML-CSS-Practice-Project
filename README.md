# HTML-CSS-Practice-Project# HTML & CSS Practice Project

A small project to practice the basics of **HTML** and **CSS**.  
I experimented with text formatting, images, and basic layout structure after completing a 4.5-hour introductory web development course.  
This project represents my early steps in front-end development.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- Structuring a web page using HTML elements  
- Styling text and images with CSS  
- Understanding basic layout and spacing  

## ðŸ§  Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS 
- VS Code  

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
I'm currently taking a 65-hour Full Stack Developer course on Udemy to deepen my knowledge in front-end and back-end development.  
My next focus areas include responsive design, Flexbox, Grid, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Node.js.
